# ImmutableSeaport

Seaport is a new marketplace protocol for safely and efficiently buying and selling NFTs.

ImmutableSeaport is a fork of the Seaport protocol based on version 1.4, restricting basic order fulfillment flows and enforcing the use of a ImmutableZone, which validates
orders based on opeartor signature. This allows for full royalty enforcement from an offchain order book.
